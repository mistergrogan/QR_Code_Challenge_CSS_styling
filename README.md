# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

"Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go."

👉Tackling this challenge allowed me to go over some CSS fundamentals/styling and flex-box to recreate the design they set in the challenge. It was a simple but fun task to go through and I felt it has helped contribute to my development in learning more about front-end and the design aspect of the role.

Thanks for stopping by 👍😎
